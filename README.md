## Story

`Blanché` is [fancy parphume from Swedish brand Byredo](https://www.byredo.com/blanche-eau-de-parfum). It's a delicate and sophisticated fragrance that evokes a sense of calm and purity. Legend says that it was designed for company's owner partner, who actually hate any scents. And it was a scandal, how you can date a "parfumer" when you hate parfumes??? And the answer was something very tender and minimalistic that could fit a person who cannot stand aroma.

## Ideas

`Blanché` – is the monochrome theme for you to forget you need a rainbow to be happy.

* Try to put emphasis to things that really important;
* Use font variations to create the rhythm otherwise created by color;
* Keep it simple;
